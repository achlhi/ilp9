This compiler is studied in a course that trains students to read code and extend it. The main features of that system are:\r\n- the input syntax is XML (checked by a RelaxNG grammar)\r\n- the processed language is somewhat similar to Javascript\r\n- the interpreter and compiler are written in Java\r\n- the compiler produces C code.\r\n\r\nThis course draws on a course that presented compilation via a series of languages where features were incrementally added. The '9' in 'ilp9' stands for the ultimate version of that series of systems.\r\n","google":"UA-5651167-4","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
