Implementation of a Programming Language 

This code has been written for a course on code reading and compiler extension. The '9' in its title stands for the ultimate version of a series of compilers handling a language with an incrementally growing number of features. 

This is the code of a compiler (and an interpreter) for a simple programming language (with first-class local functions, exceptions, classes). This compiler is studied in a course that trains students to read code and extend it. The main features of that system are:
- the input syntax is XML (checked by a RelaxNG grammar)
- the processed language is somewhat similar to Javascript
- the interpreter and compiler are written in Java
- the compiler produces C code.
